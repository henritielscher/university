## Additional Infos / Thoughts

I went for this course because it could teach me working with a CMS which I then implemented in my own work later. That said it still is WordPress and although it works well I would probably only use it as Headless CMS from now on. The barrier to entry is very high as it felt like there are a million hooks to deal with which overcomplicates things in my opinion.

Nevertheless it made me learn PHP which I really like now. When I find the time I would like to get more hands on experience with Laravel, which I discovered a few months ago, to increase my knowledge. Also the course made me deal with Webpack which opened a whole new perspective on dev tools and kept me using it on my own projects.
